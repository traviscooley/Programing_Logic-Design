    <h2>True or False</h2>
    1. You can write any program using only sequence structures.<br><span class="answer">FALSE</span><br>
    2. A program can be made of only one type of control structure. You cannot combine
    structures.<br><span class="answer">FALSE</span><br>
    3. A single alternative decision structure tests a condition and then takes one path if
    the condition is true, or another path if the condition is false.<br><span class="answer">FALSE</span><br>
    4. A decision structure can be nested inside another decision structure.<br><span class="answer">TRUE</span><br>
    5. A compound Boolean expression created with the AND operator is true only when
    both subexpressions are true.<br><span class="answer">TRUE</span><br>
    <h2>Short Answer</h2>
    1. Explain what is meant by the term conditionally executed.<br><span class="answer">Only execute when the condition is true</span><br>
    2. You need to test a condition and then execute one set of statements if the condition
    is true. If the condition is false, you need to execute a different set of statements.
    What structure will you use?<br><span class="answer">if-else</span><br>
    3. If you need to test the value of a variable and use that value to determine which
    statement or set of statements to execute, which structure would be the most
    straightforward to use?<br><span class="answer">if-then-else</span><br>
    4. Briefly describe how the AND operator works.<br><span class="answer">If both conditions are true</span><br>
    5. Briefly describe how the OR operator works.<br><span class="answer">If either or conditions are true</span><br>
    6. When determining whether a number is inside a range, which logical operator is it
    best to use?<br><span class="answer">AND operator</span><br>
    7. What is a flag and how does it work?<br><span class="answer">It is a variable that signals when some condition exists in the program</span><br>
